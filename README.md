LLM Chatbot is a project designed to provide users with a platform where they can ask any query and receive answers generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). The application is built using the OpenAI API and Langchain framework, enabling seamless integration of a powerful language model for natural language processing tasks.

## Features

- **Query and Answer System**: Users can ask questions on various topics and receive relevant answers generated by the LLM.
- **Authentication**: The application implements JWT-based authentication, ensuring that only registered users can access the system.
- **Secure Communication**: All communication between the client and the server is encrypted to maintain data integrity and user privacy.
- **Chat History**: The application integrates with a database to store each user's chat history for future reference and analysis.

## Technologies Used

- OpenAI API: Utilized for accessing the Large Language Model for generating responses to user queries.
- Langchain Framework: Integrated to facilitate seamless communication between the OpenAI API and the application.
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT): Employed for user authentication and authorization.
- Database (PostgreSQL): Integrated to store user chat history securely.
